Just in case you have not heard it yet, Flutterwave is now a Unicorn ( a company with a valuation of over $1B) less than five years after it launched. Will I gloat a lot about this? Hell, YES, I will!! The team deserves all the” accolades.” Working with them has been pure joy for me.


Will I give unwarranted advice about how to invest in winning startups? Hell, NO!! We were all lucky to be part of this by providence more than design. We all found each other, and magic happened. I also will not bore anyone with that history as it is meant for books.

What will I talk about then? Market and team ownership. The Flutterwave team exhibits the perfect form of “extreme ownership” in these parts and globally. Unicorns are rare, and it is rare qualities like this that create them. I will save you time on the explanation of” Extreme Ownership” if you can take time to watch this video and buy the book by the US Navy SEALS Jocko Willink et al.

Flutterwave is far from being a perfect company yet; the team knows that. They keep, however, striving for perfection and take every criticism as the gift of feedback. I am always amazed at the speed at which things are corrected when I highlight them privately to team members.
