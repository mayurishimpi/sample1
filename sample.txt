Just in case you have not heard it yet, Flutterwave is now a Unicorn ( a company with a valuation of over $1B) less than five years after it launched. Will I gloat a lot about this? Hell, YES, I will!! The team deserves all the” accolades.” Working with them has been pure joy for me.


Will I give unwarranted advice about how to invest in winning startups? Hell, NO!! We were all lucky to be part of this by providence more than design. We all found each other, and magic happened. I also will not bore anyone with that history as it is meant for books.
